Oil Spill Detection - Preprocessing Summary
==========================================

MILESTONE 1 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Preprocessing Pipeline Implemented:
1. RGB to Binary Mask Conversion (0=non-spill, 1=spill)
2. Image Resizing to 256x256 pixels
3. Pixel Value Normalization (0-1 range)
4. Data Augmentation Pipeline
5. Complete Visualization Pipeline

Key Achievements:
- Systematic preprocessing workflow established
- Dataset balance analyzed and documented
- Augmentation strategies implemented
- All preprocessing steps visualized and verified
- Statistics generated and saved

Data is now ready for model training phase.
All preprocessing results saved in results/preprocessing/ directory.
